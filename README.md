# ChatsKitchen — Let Chat Cook

A browser-based real-time kitchen game where Twitch chat collectively runs a restaurant. Players type commands in chat to chop, grill, fry, mix, and serve dishes before the shift timer runs out.

---

## Features

- **Twitch integration** — connect any channel and chat commands become gameplay actions
- **Cooperative chaos** — 27 recipes across 6 cuisine sets, 12 station types, one shared kitchen
- **Heat mechanic** — stations heat up during cooking; cool with `cool <station>` (40–60% reduction) or the team must `extinguish` if it overheats
- **Kitchen Events** — random mid-round challenges (hazards and opportunities) that the whole chat must respond to together
- **PvP mode** — split chat into Red and Blue teams competing for money in the same kitchen
- **Adventure mode** — roguelike multi-shift run; survive each shift to unlock the next
- **Star rating** — dynamic difficulty threshold calibrated to the actual number of players after each round
- **Bot simulation** — optional AI players fill in when chat is quiet
- **Configurable** — tune cooking speed, order speed, station capacity, kitchen events, and more in Options

## How to Play

Type commands by name in chat. Spaces in ingredient names can be written as spaces or underscores. The `!` prefix is also accepted (e.g. `!chop lettuce`).

### Commands

| Chop | `chop <item>` | Chopping Board |
| Grill | `grill <item>` | Grill |
| Fry | `fry <item>` | Fryer |
| Boil | `boil <item>` | Stove |
| Toast | `toast <item>` | Oven |
| Roast | `roast <item>` | Oven |

**Shortform aliases** (enable in Options): `c`, `g`, `f`, `b`, `t`, `r`, `sf`, `sm`, `si`, `ck`, `mx`, `gr`, `kn`, `cl`, `s` map to chop, grill, fry, boil, toast, roast, stirfry, steam, simmer, cook, mix, grind, knead, cool, serve.

### Gameplay flow

1. An order appears with a dish name and patience timer.
2. Cook the required ingredients at the appropriate stations.
3. Finished ingredients are automatically deposited into the shared prepared-items pool.
4. Once all required ingredients are in the pool, type `serve <order#>`.

Each player can only work one station at a time and has a 1.5-second command cooldown.

### Recipes

Steps marked `→` require the prior ingredient in the pool first. Steps joined by `+` can be done in any order.

### Heat & Overheat

Stations heat up **gradually during cooking** — heat is applied incrementally as each cook progresses, contributing a random 10–20% per full cook (rolled when cooking starts). The station border colour shows the current level: green (safe) → yellow → orange → red (critical). Type `cool <station>` to reduce heat by a random 40–60% (requires not currently cooking).

At 100% the station overheats: all active cooks are cancelled and the station locks. At least 50% of that round's players must type `extinguish <station>` to vote it back online. Heat resets to 0 once extinguished.

The chopping board, mixing bowl, grinder, and knead board are exempt from heat and never overheat.

### Order Spawning

If the queue is cleared, a new order spawns immediately and the spawn rate doubles for 10 seconds to keep the pressure on.

## Game Modes

### Free Play

Sandbox mode. Configure duration (1–9 min, default 3 min), cooking speed, order urgency, order frequency (all 0.25×–3.0×), station slot capacity, kitchen events, and which recipes can appear. The recipe select screen includes a **Selected** panel with Remove All, Select All, and Random 3 shortcuts. Good for practice and casual streaming.

Order capacity and spawn rate scale dynamically during the game based on the number of active players, so the kitchen stays challenging as more viewers join.

### PvP Mode

Split chat into Red and Blue teams. Each team has its own prep tray and earns money independently. The team with more money at the end wins. Join via `!red`, `!blue`, `!join`, `!join red`, or `!join blue` in the lobby.

### Adventure Mode

A roguelike multi-shift run. Each shift must meet a money goal to unlock the next. Fail a shift and the run ends. Recipes and difficulty scale as you progress through shifts.

## Twitch Integration

From the Main Menu, enter a channel name in the **Twitch Connect** card on the right panel and click **Connect**. Once connected:

- Live chat messages appear in the game's chat panel.
- Any message starting with `!` is parsed as a game command.
- The UI shows the connected channel and connection status.

The game can also be played locally without Twitch using the built-in chat input.

## Development

```bash
npm run lint     # run before committing
npm run build    # catches TypeScript errors
```

- Always develop on a branch, never directly on `main`.
- There are no automated tests. [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) + [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) is the recommended approach when adding them.
- All game logic lives in `src/state/gameReducer.ts`. Never mutate `GameState` directly — the reducer must return a new object.
- Food icons use `FoodIcon.tsx` which renders `<img>` for `/`-prefixed paths and `<span>` for emoji strings — drop SVGs into `public/icons/` and update the `emoji` field in `recipes.ts` to use the path.
